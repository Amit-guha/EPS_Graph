# **EPS GRAPH**

This  app offers a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that visualizes and presents financial data on a quarterly basis.It helps users to track and analyze stock market performance with clear insights and trends.

## Introduction
EPS stands for Earnings Per Share.It is a financial metric that is widely used to assess a company's profitability and its ability to generate earnings for its shareholders. In the stock market of Bangladesh, companies typically release their financial reports on a quarterly basis. This means that there are four quarters in a financial year for which companies disclose their earnings and other financial information. 
The financial year in Bangladesh typically runs from July to June.

The four quarters in a financial year are commonly referred to as follows:

1. First Quarter (Q1): July to September
2. Second Quarter (Q2): October to December
3. Third Quarter (Q3): January to March
4. Fourth Quarter (Q4): April to June

The graph illustrates the EPS values for a specific company over the past  and current year, divided into quarterly intervals.


## Features
In the EPS graph, the x-axis represents time, with each interval corresponding to a quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) or specific years.This allows for a clear representation of the data in a sequential manner.
On the other hand, the y-axis represents the earnings per share (EPS) values, which indicate the profitability of the company.

In this project, we have an EPS model that works with data from different companies. If you have data for multiple companies, this model makes it easy to represent and analyze that information.
